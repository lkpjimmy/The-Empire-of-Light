divide land occupied into grids by distance 2
weighting: base, attack, defense

Analyse myself:
for (different regions)
	if (easy defense more land)
		base high: use 1 troop to occupy lands
	elseif (easy defense fewer land)
		base middle: some 1 troop occupy land
	elseif (hard defense)
		base low: no 1 troop defense

Analyse myself:
for (different regions)
	if (easy defense many base)
		defense high, base low
	else if (difficult defense many base)
		defense middle, base low
	else if (easy defense fewer base)
		defense middle, base high
	else if (difficult defense fewer base)
		defense low, base low

Analyse enemy:
for (different regions)
	if (many base less army)
		attack high, defense low
	elseif (many base many army)
		attack middle, defense middle
	elseif (less base less army)
		attack middle, defense low
	elseif (less base many army)
		attack low, defense high

Detail analyse:
	strategy id: {attack, defense, base, need} {0:low, 1:middle, 2:high}
	eg.	all attack: [2,0,0]
			all defense: [0,0,2]
			base and attack: [1,0,1]

for (different regions)
	mark = attack + defense + base
	according to mark, distribute troops to satisfy the needs		

for (different regions)
	carry on corresponding strategy according to current troops
	calculate exact steps


--------------------------
hexagon each layer number: 1 > 6 > 12 > 24


determine easy defense more land:
	in two distance see the percentage of 1 distance away land blocked 
	count number of lands in this area
