divide land occupied into grids by distance 2
weighting: base, attack, defense

Analyse myself:
for (different regions)
	if (easy defense more land)
		base high: use 1 troop to occupy lands
	elseif (easy defense fewer land)
		base middle: some 1 troop occupy land
	elseif (hard defense)
		base low: no 1 troop defense

Analyse enemy:
for (different regions)
	if (many base less army)
		attack high, defense low
	elseif (many base many army)
		attack middle, defense middle
	elseif (less base less army)
		attack middle, defense low
	elseif (less base many army)
		attack low, defense high

Detail analyse:
	strategy id: {attack, defense, base, need} {0:low, 1:middle, 2:high}
	eg.	all attack: [2,0,0]
			all defense: [0,0,2]
			base and attack: [1,0,1]

for (different regions)
	mark = attack + defense + base
	according to mark, distribute troops to satisfy the needs		

for (different regions)
	carry on corresponding strategy according to current troops
	calculate exact steps
