## Decision tree

divide land occupied into grids by distance 2
weighting: base, attack, defense

Analyse myself:
for (different regions)
	if (easy defense more land)
		base high: use 1 troop to occupy lands
	elseif (easy defense fewer land)
		base middle: some 1 troop occupy land
	elseif (hard defense)
		base low: no 1 troop defense

Analyse myself:
for (different regions)
	if (easy defense many base)
		defense high, base low
	else if (difficult defense many base)
		defense middle, base low
	else if (easy defense fewer base)
		defense middle, base high
	else if (difficult defense fewer base)
		defense low, base low

Analyse enemy:
for (different regions)
	if (many base less army)
		attack high, defense low
	elseif (many base many army)
		attack middle, defense middle
	elseif (less base less army)
		attack middle, defense low
	elseif (less base many army)
		attack low, defense high

Detail analyse:
	strategy id: {attack, defense, base, need} {0:low, 1:middle, 2:high}
			// need = troops needed to complete task in that region
	eg.	all attack: [2,0,0]
			all defense: [0,0,2]
			base and attack: [1,0,1]

for (different regions)
	mark = attack + defense + base
	according to mark, distribute troops to satisfy the needs		

for (different regions)
	carry on corresponding strategy according to current troops
	calculate exact steps


--------------------------
## Determination rules

number of hexagons in each layer (from in to out): 1 > 6 > 12 > 24

count number of lands within region of distance 2 from all element in the same region

defense:
	if the opening (distance=3) in that region:
		>5:difficult, <=5:easy

army enemy/alliance:
	number of troops in that region 

land area:
	number of land in that region

base:
	number of unoccupied lands in that region
